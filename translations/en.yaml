  title: ¿What is Pilas Engine?
  text: |-
    Pilas is a tool for making video games in a fun and simple way.

    We made this tool for so that young people can discover and learn to program
    computers. We believe that learning to program video games is something so
    spectacular that all people should be able to do it. Learn to code lets you
    take control of computers to invent, share and develop any type of software.

    The interface icons have been created by Icons8, while the game graphics have
    been created by Walter Velazquez and the kenney project.

    In addition, we are sponsored by EnjambreBit, a company that makes it possible
    for us to keep developing and improving the tool every day.
